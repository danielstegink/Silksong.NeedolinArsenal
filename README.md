# Needolin Arsenal
About 2 months after the game came out, I saw an animated short 
in which Hornet attached the Voltvessel to her Needolin and 
turned it into an electric guitar that plays rock music and 
shoots laser beams. I thought to myself, "I can make that".

This mod gives the Needolin combat potential by applying new
synergies based on equipped tools. If one or more of the 
following is equipped, the mod will randomly pick one, then play
its assigned music clip and apply its designated effect:
- Voltvessels wrap the Silk in lightning, causing the Needolin
to play rock music and spawn lightning bolts around Hornet like 
Trobbio fireworks.
- Plasmium Phial coats the Silk in plasmium, causing the Needolin
to play jazz music and regenerate lifeblood.
- Wispfire Lantern lights the Silk on fire, causing the Needolin
to play country music and spawn wisps when enemies are nearby.
- Pin Badge sharpens the Silk into blades, causing the Needolin 
to play traditional Japanese shamisen music and spawn Cross 
Slashes on nearby enemies.
